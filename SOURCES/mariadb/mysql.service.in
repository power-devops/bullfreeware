# It's not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will be
# overwritten during package upgrades.  If you want to customize, the
# best way is to create a file "/etc/systemd/system/@DAEMON_NAME@.service",
# containing
#	.include /usr/lib/systemd/system/@DAEMON_NAME@.service
#	...make your changes here...
# or create a file "/etc/systemd/system/@DAEMON_NAME@.service.d/foo.conf",
# which doesn't need to include ".include" call and which will be parsed
# after the file @DAEMON_NAME@.service itself is parsed.
#
# For more info about custom unit files, see systemd.unit(5) or
# http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Systemd#How_do_I_customize_a_unit_file.2F_add_a_custom_unit_file.3F

# For example, if you want to increase mysql's open-files-limit to 10000,
# you need to increase systemd's LimitNOFILE setting, so create a file named
# "/etc/systemd/system/@DAEMON_NAME@.service.d/limits.conf" containing:
#	[Service]
#	LimitNOFILE=10000

# Note: /usr/lib/... is recommended in the .include line though /lib/...
# still works.
# Don't forget to reload systemd daemon after you change unit configuration:
# root> systemctl --system daemon-reload

# Use [mysqld.INSTANCENAME] as sections in my.cnf to configure this instance.
