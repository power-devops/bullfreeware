+ .SH DESCRIPTION
+ This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
+ because the original program does not have a manual page.
+ .PP
+ .B type1afm
+ reads in Type 1 font files specified on the command line, rasterizes
+ them to 1000bp, and writes AFM (font metrics) files based on the
+ observed metrics information.
+ .PP
+ The AFM file is created in the same directory as the font file, so be
+ sure that you have write access there before running this program.

+ .TH XGLYPH 1
+ .SH NAME
+ xglyph \- demonstration program for the t1lib font rasterizer library.
+ .SH SYNOPSIS
+ .B xglyph
+ [
+ .B fontfile...
+ ]
+ .SH "DESCRIPTION"
+ This manual page documents briefly the
+ .BR xglyph
+ program.
+ This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
+ because the original program does not have a manual page.
+ .PP
+ .B xglyph
+ is a program which demonstrates the capabilities of the
+ .B t1lib
+ library.  It allows the user to view an arbitrary character or string
+ rendered in the various ways pgossible with the library.  By default,
+ it writes a log file named \fIt1lib.log\fR in the current directory.
+ .PP
+ If invoked with no arguments, it will attempt to read the global
+ configuration file and font database.  It will also accept any number
+ of filenames on the command line, in which case these are treated as
+ font files to be loaded instead of the default font database.

+ .TH FONTDATABASE 5
+ .SH NAME
+ FontDataBase \- database of fonts accessible to t1lib.
+ .SH DESCRIPTION
+ This manual page has been written for the Debian GNU/Linux
+ distribution.  It has been adapted from the documentation included in
+ the upstream
+ .B t1lib
+ distribution.
+ .PP
+ .B /opt/freeware/etc/t1lib/FontDataBase
+ is a text file which contains, minimally, the basenames of Type 1 font 
+ files to be made accessible to the
+ .B t1lib
+ font rasterizer library.  The format is intentionally similar to that
+ of the
+ .B fonts.dir
+ and
+ .B fonts.scale
+ files used by X11.
+ .PP
+ Line 1 of this file contains a positive integer specifying the number
+ of fonts declared in that file. This is as in the
+ .B fonts.dir
+ files of the X11 system.
+ .PP
+ All remaining lines contain declarations of one font each. The only
+ thing taken from such a line is the last string (delimited by white
+ space) in it. It is assumed to be a filename of the format
+ \fIbasename\fR.\fIsomeextension\fR.
+ .PP
+ The \fIbasename\fR part is assumed to be the
+ .BR basename (1)
+ of a fontfile.  After the a string has been parsed, the
+ .I extension
+ is cut off and replaced in turn with
+ .I .pfa
+ and
+ .I .pfb.
+ The initialization routine tries to open a font file in
+ its search path with one of the resulting filenames.
+ .PP
+ The remainder of the line, i.e., from beginning to the start of the
+ filename string, is completely ignored and thus may contain
+ information for other programs.
+ .SH EXAMPLES
+ Here is a minimal font database file for 4 fonts:
+ .sp
+ .nf
+ 4
+ isvl.afm
+ isvli.afm
+ isvd.afm
+ isvdi.afm
+ .fi
+ .PP
+ This file is \fIminimal\fR, because it contains just the information
+ needed, and nothing not needed by the library. 
+ .PP
+ Here is a more realistic example, which allows an application to match
+ a fully qualified X11 fontname to a FontID in
+ .B t1lib.
+ This is also a valid font database file:
+ .sp
+ .nf
+ 4
