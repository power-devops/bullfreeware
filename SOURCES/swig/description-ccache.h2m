ccache-swig - a fast compiler cache

[description]
ccache-swig  is a compiler cache. It speeds up re-compilation of C/C++/SWIG
code by caching previous compiles and detecting when the same compile is
being done again. ccache-swig is ccache plus support for SWIG.

[notes]
For more information, see @DOCDIR@/swig-doc/Doc/Manual/CCache.html from the
