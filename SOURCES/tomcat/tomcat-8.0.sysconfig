# Service-specific configuration file for tomcat. This will be sourced by
# systemd for the default service (tomcat.service)
# If you want to customize named instance, make a similar file
# and name it tomcat@instancename.

# You will not need to set this, usually. For default service it equals
# CATALINA_HOME. For named service, it equals ${TOMCATS_BASE}${NAME}
#CATALINA_BASE="@@@TCHOME@@@"

# Please take a look at /etc/tomcat/tomcat.conf to have an idea what you
# can override.
